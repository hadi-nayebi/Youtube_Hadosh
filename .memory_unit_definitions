# Memory Unit Definitions

This file contains definitions for memory units that can be used in the working memory. Each memory unit has a specific structure and purpose.

## Available Memory Units

### Task

Structure:
```json
{
  "id": "tsk-{unique alphanumeric, 7 chars}",
  "creation_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "last_update": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "title": "Brief task description (max 50 chars)",
  "description": "Detailed task description (max 200 chars)",
  "status": "Not Started | In Progress | Completed | On Hold",
  "priority": "Low | Medium | High",
  "assigned_to": "User or AI agent responsible for the task",
  "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "subtasks": ["list of subtask ids"],
  "comments": ["list of comments"],
  "tags": ["list of relevant tags"]
}
```

Purpose: The Task memory unit is designed to track and manage individual tasks within the working memory. It provides a consistent structure for task information, enabling efficient task management, progress tracking, etc.

Usage:
- Create a new task in the working memory by providing the required information.
- Update the task status, priority, assigned user, due date, etc., as needed.
- Add subtasks to break down complex tasks into smaller actionable items.
- Add comments to provide additional context, updates, or notes related to the task.
- Use the id if you want to reference a task in another part of the working memory.
- The full definition of a new task must always appear once in the working memory and id must be used in other sections.

### Comment

Structure:
```json
{
  "id": "cmt-{unique alphanumeric, 7 chars}",
  "creation_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "last_update": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "content": "(max 50 words)",
  "source": "Name of the source, or id if available"
}
```

Purpose: The comment is a way to provide additional context, updates, or notes related to another memory unit, such as a task, output, deliverable, etc.

Usage:
- The comment is linked to another memory unit.
- Use the comment id to reference the comment in the linked memory unit.
- The comment can be used to provide additional context, updates, or notes related to the linked memory unit.
